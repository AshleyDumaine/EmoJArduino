If you get a compiler warning on the gnu.io.CommPort import:

Modify your build path to explicitly allow access to the gnu.io.CommPort class:

1. Open the Libraries tab of the Java Build Path project property window.
2. Expand the JRE System Library entry.
3. Select "Access rules" and hit the Edit button.
4. Click the Add button in the resulting dialog.
5. For the new access rule, set the resolution to Accessible and the pattern to "gnu/io/**".
